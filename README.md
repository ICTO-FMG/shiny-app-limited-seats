# Shiny app limited seats

This is the repository for a Shiny app for the UvA. The goal is to randomly select students for lectures with limited seats, based on the number of students, lectures and available seats.
In the Shiny app a lecturer pastes all student names in the text area, fills in the number of lectures and available seats and then presses GO. Now a table shows with the lecture groups. The table can be downloaded as an Excel file.
